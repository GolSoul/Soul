## 📈 Strategy Logic Explanation

### Signal Generation Process

#### 1. **Trend Analysis** (25% weight default)
- **Primary condition:** Fast EMA > Slow EMA (bullish) or Fast EMA < Slow EMA (bearish)
- **Enhancement:** Trend strength calculation based on EMA separation percentage
- **Purpose:** Identifies the primary market direction with strength measurement

#### 2. **MACD Momentum** (20% weight default)
- **Bullish condition:** MACD line > Signal line AND MACD > 0
- **Bearish condition:** MACD line < Signal line AND MACD < 0
- **Enhancement:** Momentum strength based on MACD line separation
- **Purpose:** Confirms trend direction with momentum analysis

#### 3. **RSI Analysis** (20% weight default)
- **Bullish condition:** RSI > 50 AND RSI < 70 (momentum without overbought)
- **Bearish condition:** RSI < 50 AND RSI > 30 (momentum without oversold)
- **Enhancement:** Avoids extreme overbought/oversold conditions
- **Purpose:** Ensures optimal entry timing within momentum cycles

#### 4. **Volatility Confirmation** (20% weight default)
- **Condition:** Current ATR > Average ATR (expanding volatility)
- **Enhancement:** Detects volatility expansion for better breakout trades
- **Purpose:** Confirms sufficient market activity for profitable moves

#### 5. **ADX Trend Strength** (15% weight default)
- **Condition:** ADX > minimum threshold (default 20)
- **Enhancement:** Rising ADX detection for strengthening trends
- **Purpose:** Filters out weak, directionless market conditions

#### 6. **Multi-Timeframe Confirmation** (10% weight when enabled)
- **Higher timeframe trend:** EMA alignment on selected higher timeframe
- **Higher timeframe MACD:** MACD confirmation on higher timeframe
- **Purpose:** Reduces false signals by ensuring multi-timeframe alignment

### Risk Management Logic

#### Stop-Loss Calculation
```pinescript
Stop Loss = Entry Price ± (ATR × Stop Loss Multiplier)
```

#### Take-Profit Calculation  
```pinescript
Take Profit = Entry Price ± (ATR × Take Profit Multiplier)
```

#### Risk/Reward Ratio
```pinescript
R/R Ratio = (Take Profit - Entry) / (Entry - Stop Loss)
```
